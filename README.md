# Multiple_Parsers
Various Parsers made in a single Compilers homework assignment


These Parsers will not work on their own and are just meant to display the work that was done since the setup for these projects was very complex.

BinaryLexer accepts any binary string so long as a 0 is immediately followed by a 1

BinaryPalindrome accepts any binary palindrome (things like 101 and 10101)

BooleanParser accepts any valid boolean statement, even if the variables aren't confirmed to be booleans, e.g. (fred || gred)

DoubleParser accepts any int or double declaration or initialization in Java's syntax. For simplicity's sake, and int can actually have a double value, like 1.1. Examples include things like: double x; double x, y = 10, z;

Props accepts names followed by blocks denoted with curly brackets. Inside these blocks can be key-value pairs or more blocks.
